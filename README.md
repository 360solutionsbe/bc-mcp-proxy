## TL;DR

- **What you get**: ask Claude (or another AI client) *"show me the top 10 customers in CRONUS USA by outstanding balance"* and it pulls that data live from **your** BC environment over a secure, authenticated connection. No exports, no copy-paste, no intermediate step.
- **What it costs**: nothing in licenses — MCP is built into BC starting from version 26 (May 2025 release wave). You choose your AI client (Claude Desktop is free for personal use).
- **The hard part**: creating an Azure App Registration with the right permissions. Ten minutes for someone IT-comfortable; the toughest part for everyone else. We're happy to help — see the [Need help?](#need-help) section.

## Quick install (Claude Desktop)

Pre-built `.dxt` bundles are published on each release with all Python dependencies vendored — no `pip install` step required.

1. **Download** the bundle for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/360solutionsbe/bc-mcp-proxy/releases/latest):

   | Platform | Asset |
   |---|---|
   | Windows 64-bit | `bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-win-amd64.dxt` |
   | macOS Apple Silicon | `bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-darwin-arm64.dxt` |
   | macOS Intel | `bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-darwin-x86_64.dxt` |
   | Linux x86_64 | `bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-linux-x86_64.dxt` |

2. **Double-click** the downloaded file. Claude Desktop opens an install dialog.
3. **Fill in** Tenant ID, Client ID, Environment, Company, (optional) Configuration Name. The defaults already point at the BC v28 endpoint; override via the *Business Central MCP endpoint* field for v26/v27.
4. **Restart Claude Desktop.**

That's the whole install. The Azure App Registration setup is the only remaining step — see [Step 1 — Azure App Registration](#step-1--azure-app-registration) below, or contact us via the [Need help?](#need-help) section if you'd prefer it done for you.

> Building from source (`pwsh dxt/build.ps1` or `./dxt/build.sh`) produces an identical bundle. Use the build path if you want to inspect the artifact, customise the manifest, or ship a private fork.

## What this fork adds

- ✅ **Reconnect on transient upstream errors.** `httpx.ReadTimeout`, `RemoteProtocolError`, and `NetworkError` (including the same errors wrapped in an `ExceptionGroup` by anyio) trigger an exponential backoff reconnect — `1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s`, default 5 attempts. The local stdio pipe to your MCP client stays open while reconnecting.
- ✅ **Pre-emptive MSAL silent token refresh.** Each acquired access token's expiry is tracked locally; when remaining validity drops below `token_refresh_skew_seconds` (default 300) the next call asks MSAL to mint a new token via `acquire_token_silent(force_refresh=True)` instead of letting Business Central reject the stale one with `Authentication_InvalidCredentials`.
- ✅ **Surface masked upstream errors.** Some Business Central MCP responses ship with `isError: false` but the content is actually an error message ("Semantic search is not enabled", "Authentication_InvalidCredentials", etc.). The proxy now flags those as real MCP errors so the client sees them.
- ✅ **BC v28 endpoint support.** Auto-detects `mcp.businesscentral.dynamics.com` and switches to the new header-based routing (TenantId + EnvironmentName headers) while keeping v26/v27 behaviour intact.
- ✅ **Cold-start mitigation.** Three-tier `tools/list` cache (disk → in-memory pre-warm → upstream) masks BC's 30s+ first-call latency that otherwise trips Claude Desktop's hardcoded MCP request timeout. See [Cold-start mitigation](#cold-start-mitigation).
- ✅ **SSRF hardening.** `BC_BASE_URL` is validated at startup: scheme must be `https`, host must be `*.businesscentral.dynamics.com`. Override via `BC_ALLOW_NON_STANDARD_BASE_URL=1` for local mock testing.
- ✅ **Pinned transitive dependencies.** Explicit security floors for `h11`, `cryptography`, `pyjwt`, `python-multipart`, `starlette`, `urllib3`, `requests`, `python-dotenv` — eliminates 16 CVE paths Snyk flagged in the upstream `mcp`/`msal`/`httpx` transitive trees. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- ✅ **Pytest test suite.** 95 tests cover error classification, backoff progression, MSAL refresh-skew boundaries, masked-error pattern matching, v28 endpoint detection, OAuth scope auto-switch, the persistent tools cache, and `base_url` validation.

The CLI surface is unchanged — every flag and env var from the upstream sample still works.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

MCP is an **open standard** Anthropic published in 2024, since adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft and most of the AI tooling industry. It solves one problem: how do you give an AI assistant safe access to your data and systems without building a bespoke integration for every combination?

- An **MCP server** sits on the side of the system that exposes data or actions — in our case, Business Central.
- An **MCP client** is the AI tool the user interacts with — Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT desktop with MCP support.
- Between them, **tools** are exchanged in a standardised format: name, description, parameter schema, and the result of an invocation.

Microsoft has, since **Business Central 2025 release wave 1 (version 26)**, shipped a built-in MCP server in every BC environment. It listens on a Microsoft-hosted endpoint, validates your OAuth token, and exposes your configuration as a set of tools the AI client can call.

## What this proxy does (and why you need it)

The BC MCP server speaks **HTTP** — a streamable-HTTP variant with Server-Sent Events. Most AI clients (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor) run locally on your machine and speak **stdio** to their MCP servers, not HTTP.

The proxy is the translator:

```
┌─────────────────┐  stdio    ┌──────────────────┐  HTTPS + OAuth   ┌────────────────────────┐
│  Claude Desktop │ ◄────────►│ bc-mcp-proxy     │ ◄───────────────►│ Business Central MCP   │
│  / VS Code      │           │ (on your machine)│                  │ (Microsoft-hosted)     │
└─────────────────┘           └──────────────────┘                  └────────────────────────┘
```

## Prerequisites

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **BC environment** | Version 26.0 or later. Sandbox or production. The MCP feature is enabled by default from v26. |
| **Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) tenant** | With **administrator** rights — you'll create an App Registration and grant API permissions. |
| **An AI client** | Claude Desktop (free), VS Code with MCP support, Cursor, or any other stdio-MCP capable tool. |
| **Python 3.10+** on your machine | Claude Desktop launches the proxy with the system `python3`. The DXT bundle vendors all Python dependencies internally (Windows `cp310-win_amd64` wheels), so no separate `pip install` is required. |

---

## Step-by-step setup

### Step 1 — Azure App Registration

In the Azure portal:

1. Open **Microsoft Entra ID** → **App registrations** → **New registration**.
2. Name it something recognisable, e.g. `BC MCP Proxy — production`.
3. Supported account types: **Accounts in this organizational directory only** (single tenant).
4. Leave the Redirect URI blank for now.
5. Click **Register**. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.

Then in the same app:

6. **Authentication** → **Add a platform** → **Mobile and desktop applications** → enter:
   ```
   ms-appx-web://Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin/<your-client-id>
   ```
7. Lower on the same page: set **"Allow public client flows"** to **Yes**, save.

Permissions:

8. **API permissions** → **Add a permission** → **Dynamics 365 Business Central** → **Delegated permissions**:
   - Tick `Financials.ReadWrite.All` (or `Financials.Read.All` for read-only).
   - Tick `user_impersonation`.
9. Click **Add permissions**, then **Grant admin consent for [tenant]**.

> Without admin consent the first sign-in will fail. The green checkmarks next to each permission after *Grant admin consent* are the signal that you're done.

### Step 2 — Create a BC MCP Configuration

In Business Central, in your target environment:

1. Search for **"MCP Server Configurations"** (the page is also titled *Model Context Protocol Server Configurations*).
2. Click **+ New**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: e.g. `Default MCP`. The name flows through as a header — case and trailing whitespace matter.
   - **Active**: **switch on**. ← *The* most common pitfall: you save the page (BC shows "Saved"), but Active is off by default. Without `Active = Yes` BC rejects every tool call with *"The MCP Configuration named X was not found or not active"*.
   - **Dynamic Tool Mode**:
     - **Off (Static mode)** — BC generates one `List_<EntityName>_PAG<id>` tool per selected page. Predictable, fast, but you choose tools up front.
     - **On (Dynamic mode)** — BC offers three generic tools (`bc_actions_search`, `bc_actions_describe`, `bc_actions_invoke`) that let the AI client search, describe and invoke an action at runtime. Far more flexible, but slower on first call (see below).
   - **Discover Additional Objects** (only relevant in dynamic mode): tick this to expose objects outside your explicit toolset for read-only discovery.
4. Add **System Tools** or **Available Tools** as needed.
5. **Save**.

> **Tip**: create two configurations with the same toolset, one with `Active = No` and one with `Active = Yes`. That way you can experiment safely without touching the live config.

### Step 3 — Install the proxy

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade 360solutions-bc-mcp
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/360solutionsbe/bc-mcp-proxy.git
cd bc-mcp-proxy
python -m pip install -e .
```

Verify:

```bash
python -m bc_mcp_proxy --help
```

### Step 4 — Configure

Create a `.env` next to the proxy (this file is git-ignored):

```ini
BC_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>
BC_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id-from-step-1>
BC_ENVIRONMENT=Production
BC_COMPANY=CRONUS USA
BC_CONFIGURATION_NAME=Default MCP
```

**For BC v26 or v27** add:

```ini
BC_BASE_URL=https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com
```

(BC v28 is now the default — Microsoft's documented endpoint for non-Microsoft MCP clients. The proxy auto-switches both the OAuth scope and the request headers to match.)

### Step 5 — Wire it into your AI client

#### Claude Desktop

Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows) or `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "business-central": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "bc_mcp_proxy",
        "--TenantId", "<your-tenant-id>",
        "--ClientId", "<your-client-id>",
        "--Environment", "Production",
        "--Company", "CRONUS USA",
        "--ConfigurationName", "Default MCP"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Your BC tools are now available in every chat.

#### VS Code / Cursor

Both support MCP via a similar JSON config. The repository ships a `python -m bc_mcp_proxy setup` wizard that generates ready-to-paste install links for Cursor and VS Code, plus a Claude Desktop snippet:

```bash
python -m bc_mcp_proxy setup
```

### Step 6 — First sign-in

The very first tool call walks the **device code flow**:

```
To sign in, use a web browser to open https://microsoft.com/devicelogin
and enter the code ABCD-1234 to authenticate.
```

Open the URL, paste the code, sign in with the Azure account that has the BC permissions. Your token is then cached locally (via `msal-extensions` with platform-specific secure storage). Subsequent runs are non-interactive until expiry — at which point the proxy refreshes silently using the refresh token.

---

## First test: ask your AI

Restart your AI client and try:

- *"Show me the top 5 customers in CRONUS USA."*
- *"Which vendors have an outstanding balance over €5,000?"*
- *"List Sales Invoices from last month with status Open."*

In **static mode** the AI picks the tool directly (e.g. `ListCustomers_PAG30009`) with parameters (`top: 5`).

In **dynamic mode** you'll see three steps — `bc_actions_search` → `bc_actions_describe` → `bc_actions_invoke`.

Both modes return the same data. Which one to choose depends on how big your BC installation is and how much flexibility you want to give the AI.

---

## Static vs Dynamic Tool Mode

| | **Static** | **Dynamic** |
|---|---|---|
| **Tools the AI sees** | One per selected page (e.g. 10 tools) | Three generic tools |
| **First-call performance** | Fast (sub-second) | Slow on first call (50–60s when *Discover Additional Objects* is on, while BC walks the catalog) |
| **Subsequent calls** | Fast | Fast — the catalog is cached |
| **AI prompt cost** | Higher (the AI sees all tool schemas) | Lower (only three meta-tools) |
| **Best for** | A bounded set of use cases you've explicitly chosen to expose | Flexible exploration, especially with many pages |

Our recommendation: start with **static mode** for the first test (fast feedback, you know exactly which tools exist). Switch to **dynamic** once your users start asking things you didn't preselect a tool for.

---

## BC version compatibility

Microsoft changed the MCP endpoint shape in BC v28, and now documents only the v28 host for non-Microsoft MCP clients. The proxy detects the host you point it at and adapts everything — URL shape, request headers, **and OAuth scope** — automatically:

| BC version | `BC_BASE_URL`                                  | URL shape                             | Routing info                                  | OAuth scope                                                 |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 28+ (default) | `https://mcp.businesscentral.dynamics.com`    | bare host, no path                    | `TenantId` + `EnvironmentName` headers (plus `Company`, `ConfigurationName`) | `https://mcp.businesscentral.dynamics.com/.default`         |
| 26 / 27    | `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com`     | `/v2.0/{environment}/mcp` is appended | `Company`, `ConfigurationName` headers        | `https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com/.default`         |

Switching versions is a single-line change in `.env` or `--BaseUrl` — the scope and headers follow automatically. Set `BC_TOKEN_SCOPE` only if you need to override the auto-pick.

### Cold-start mitigation

BC's MCP endpoint can take 30s+ to answer the very first `tools/list` call after the environment has been idle, which is longer than Claude Desktop's hardcoded MCP request timeout. The proxy masks this with a three-tier cache:

1. On startup, load the previously cached tools list from disk (per tenant/environment/company/configuration).
2. After the upstream session connects, eagerly pre-warm `tools/list` and refresh both the in-memory and disk caches.
3. The stdio handler answers from the in-memory cache (5-minute TTL) instead of round-tripping to BC on every call.

The very first install on a freshly cold-started BC environment may still hit the 30s timeout once — there is no disk cache yet to fall back on. Every subsequent launch is instant.

Token cache locations (when no custom auth header is supplied):

- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BcMCPProxyPython\bc_mcp_proxy.bin`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Caches/BcMCPProxyPython/bc_mcp_proxy.bin`
- **Linux**: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/BcMCPProxyPython/bc_mcp_proxy.bin` (or `~/.cache/…`)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`The MCP Configuration named X was not found or not active`.** Open the configuration in BC and verify the **Active** toggle is on. Saving the page does not flip Active automatically. The error also fires when the `ConfigurationName` header value differs from the BC record by even a trailing space.
- **Authentication failures.** Verify the redirect URL format (`ms-appx-web://Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin/<clientID>`) and that *"Allow public client flows"* is enabled on the Azure app registration; ensure all API permissions are granted (and admin-consented where required); rerun setup if the device flow times out.
- **Calls hang or time out (especially in Dynamic Tool Mode).** The first `bc_actions_search` against a configuration with *Discover Additional Objects* enabled enumerates the entire metadata catalog — measured at 50–60s server-side on a Cronus demo. Raise `BC_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 120) if you see `httpx.ReadTimeout` on the first call. Subsequent calls within the same session are typically sub-second.
- **JSON-RPC `-32603 "An error occurred."` with no detail.** This is BC's catch-all when something inside a dynamic-tool call goes wrong. The actual reason is logged to Azure Application Insights as event `RT0054` with custom dimension `toolInvocationFailureReason`. Enable telemetry on the BC environment and query (`traces | where customDimensions.eventId == 'RT0054' | where customDimensions.toolInvocationResult == 'Failure'`) to see what BC actually rejected.
- **Frequent reconnects in logs.** Inspect upstream availability — the proxy logs `Upstream connection error (...); reconnecting in Xs (attempt N/M)` whenever it retries. After the configured budget the proxy gives up and the local stdio pipe closes.
- **Repeated sign-in prompts.** The MSAL token cache may not be writable. Pass `--DeviceCacheLocation` to point at a directory you control.
- **`No module named bc_mcp_proxy`.** Install the distribution into the same Python interpreter your MCP client is configured to launch (`python -m pip install --upgrade 360solutions-bc-mcp`).

---

## Why this fork?

Three issues were reproducible against the upstream `BcMCPProxyPython` sample in production-style use:

1. **Process crash on `httpx.ReadTimeout`.** The upstream `streamablehttp_client` is wrapped in an anyio task group; an unhandled timeout bubbles out as a `BaseExceptionGroup` and tears down the entire proxy, killing the stdio pipe to the MCP client. This fork wraps the upstream connection in a manager that reconnects with exponential backoff while keeping the local stdio server alive.

2. **No silent token refresh.** Access tokens are valid for ~60 minutes. Once expired, every `bc_actions_invoke` call returns `Authentication_InvalidCredentials` until the proxy is restarted. This fork tracks each token's `expires_in` and refreshes pre-emptively when remaining validity drops below `token_refresh_skew_seconds`.

3. **Masked errors.** Several upstream responses set `isError: false` even when the content is an error message — for example *"Semantic search is not enabled for this environment"*. Clients display those as normal output and the user has no idea why their query "didn't work." This fork inspects responses for known error patterns and re-flags them as MCP errors.

The CLI surface and on-disk configuration layout are unchanged so this is a drop-in replacement.

---

## Claude Desktop Extension

A `.dxt` bundle for one-click install in Claude Desktop is built from the source in [`dxt/`](dxt/README.md):

```bash
pwsh dxt/build.ps1     # Windows
./dxt/build.sh         # macOS / Linux
```

The output (`dist/bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-<platform>.dxt`) installs into Claude Desktop, prompts for tenant ID / client ID / environment / company / configuration name, and runs the same proxy as the CLI version.

**Self-contained bundle.** The build script vendors all Python dependencies (`mcp`, `httpx`, `msal`, plus the security-floor pins) into the bundle as Python-3.10 wheels matching the host platform. Claude Desktop launches the proxy with the system `python3` and the bundled deps take precedence over anything in the system's site-packages, so no separate `pip install` is required on the install side. Each platform has its own bundle:

| Platform | Filename pattern |
|---|---|
| Windows 64-bit | `bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-win-amd64.dxt` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-darwin-arm64.dxt` |
| macOS Intel | `bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-darwin-x86_64.dxt` |
| Linux x86_64 | `bc-mcp-proxy-<version>-linux-x86_64.dxt` |

Build on each target platform's host (a Windows machine for the Windows bundle, etc.), or in a CI matrix.

---

## Security

- **No application secrets.** Delegated permissions only via the device-code flow. No client secret to manage or rotate.
- **Tokens cached locally** via `msal-extensions` with OS-specific secure storage (DPAPI on Windows, Keychain on macOS, libsecret on Linux). No plaintext on disk.
- **No tokens in logs.** The proxy never logs access or refresh tokens; debug output contains only expiry timestamps for diagnosis.
- **Permissions are delegated.** Whatever the proxy can see and do, the signed-in user could already do manually in BC. The AI gets no extra rights.
- **Configuration name as gate.** In BC you decide per MCP Configuration which pages and objects are exposed. Put sensitive data behind a separate configuration that you only flip Active for specific users.

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/360solutionsbe/bc-mcp-proxy.git
cd bc-mcp-proxy
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"
python -m pytest
```
